# GAINZ

Never know what part of your body you're perfecting today? Now you do.

A simple app built with [Rebolt](https://rebolt.callstack.com/) and [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/).

## Getting started
1. Run `yarn` in the root directory
1. Run `yarn watch` in one terminal for crazy fast compiles.
1. Run `yarn ios` or `yarn android` for bundling and simulating as fast as metro thinks it can go.
